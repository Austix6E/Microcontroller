!!! GENERAL !!!

-Definition of stages:
	Stage-1 : Research & basic verilog implementation
	Stage-2 : Full HDL synthesis & testing
	Stage-3 : Real world FPGA testing
	Stage-4 : VHDL design
	Stage-5 : Full regression testing
	Stage-6 : *maybe* Fab production & testing

!!! ADDERS !!!

-I am going to make an initial assumption that a CLA4 is going to be the best optimization
	however before Stage-3 I would also like to analyse a CSA & a Lynch-Swartzlander adder
